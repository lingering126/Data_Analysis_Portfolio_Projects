## Covid Statistics Analysis

This is a data analysis project about covid statistics. I use sql to retrieve some data and used Tableau to do a dashboard.

The data source time range starts from Jan 2020 to Oct 2021.

The dashboard includes:
- Global overview of total cases, death cases and death percentage.
- Total death cases per continent.
- Percent population infected by country (displaying in a world map)
- Percent population infected by time of some main countries.

Thanks for *Alex the analyst* providing the ideas and totorials:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsMg
